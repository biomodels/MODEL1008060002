Munz2009 - Zombie SIZRQ

This is the model with latent infection and quarantine described in the
article.

This model was originally created by libAntimony v1.4 (using libSBML 3.4.1).

This model is described in the article:

Abstract:

Zombies are a popular figure in pop culture/entertainment and they are usually
portrayed as being brought about through an outbreak or epidemic.
Consequently, we model a zombie attack, using biological assumptions based on
popular zombie movies. We introduce a basic model for zombie infection,
determine equilibria and their stability, and illustrate the outcome with
numerical solutions. We then refine the model to introduce a latent period of
zombification, whereby humans are infected, but not infectious, before
becoming undead. We then modify the model to include the effects of possible
quarantine or a cure. Finally, we examine the impact of regular, impulsive
reductions in the number of zombies and derive conditions under which
eradication can occur. We show that only quick, aggressive attacks can stave
off the doomsday scenario: the collapse of society as zombies overtake us all.
